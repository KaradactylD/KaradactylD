📌 Featured Projects

90s Time Capsule:
A MySpace-inspired web app with profile customization, guestbook, and mood emoticons, built with C#, ASP.NET, and a retro 90s vibe.
⭐ Check it out for neon colors and Comic Sans nostalgia!

Friday the 13th Slot Machine:
A spine-chilling slot machine game with a Friday the 13th theme, built in C# using Windows Forms. Features include animated spins, creepy sound effects, and a “Jason’s Trophy Case” mini-game triggered by 4+ “mom” symbols, where players pick prizes like Pamela’s sweater for big bonuses.
⭐ Spin the reels for a horror-filled thrill! 

Fairy Game:
A magical Java-based arcade game where a fairy collects colorful flowers (purple, pink, orange, blue, red) for points in an enchanted forest. Features dynamic flower spawning (red flowers are rare!), a pulsing mushroom glow, and a retro 90s-inspired aesthetic. Built with Java and Swing for smooth gameplay.
⭐ Flutter through the forest and rack up points!
